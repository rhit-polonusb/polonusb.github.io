            <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! I am a sophomore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, planning to graduate in 2024 in Computer Science. I have been programming since late elementary school, first designing games in Python. This taught me many critical programming concepts early, which not only allows me to excel in my CS classes at Rose-Hulman, but also continue designing increasingly complex games with my brother. Despite the game history, my specific focus within the field of Computer Science has become Machine Learning, and currently I plan to obtain a Master's in the field.</p>
            <p>This portfolio contains a selection of the projects I have undertaken whle at Rose-Hulman, and also contains an up-to-date resume in the resume tab. Not only that, but this entire website and the server it lives on was written and is being hosted by myself. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at polonusb@rose-hulman.edu or call me at (217)-372-8899</p>
